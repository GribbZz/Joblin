~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ HOW TO ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*===================================================*

Initial Setup:
1.) Create a general "Job" folder for which Joblin will create the inital job tree.
2.) Move the Joblin script into the previously created job folder.
3.) Run Joblin as admin for full functionality!
4.) Enjoy ~ He's a nice chap!

Use:
Start Joblin at the beginning of a job to set-up a job tree in order to make sorting documents and tool-output easier!
(Once you've spoken to Joblin at the start thats it!)
